# Url-Shortener
This is a URL sshortener app built using Flask and Python.

The Url shortener allows the user to shorten a url of their choice using keywords of their choice or they can have it generated for them in a random fashion.
The user can then use the shortened url to redirect to the original url.

The next step for this shortener would be to create a login page and implement some authentication and authorization.
The user can then view all the urls they have shortened and also delete them if they want to.

I also need a Database to store the shortened urls and the original urls.
will do that in the next version of the app.


The website is live at : https://url-shortener-n6zk.onrender.com/
